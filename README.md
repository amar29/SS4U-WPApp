Ionic app for wordpress

How to use this app
-------------------

This app does not work on its own. It is missing the Ionic library, and cordova plugins.

To use this, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy and paste this into an existing Cordova project and download a release of Ionic separately.

Installation
-----------

```
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ sudo ionic start myApp balnk
```
